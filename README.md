### Project 1
Vaccine sentiment classifier using softmax regression.

### Project 2
Vaccine sentiment classifier with 3 classes (neutral, anti-vax and pro-vax) using
feed-forward neural networks and GloVe word embedding
vectors.

### Project 3
Sentiment classifier with 3 classes (pro-vax, anti-vax, neutral) using a bidirectional stacked RNN with LSTM/GRU cells, attention layer and GloVe word embedding
vectors.

### Project 4
##### Task 1:
Sentiment classifier with 3 classes (pro-vax, anti-vax, neutral) by fine-tuning the pretrained BERT-base model
##### Task 2:
Model for question answering on the dataset SQuAD 2.0
